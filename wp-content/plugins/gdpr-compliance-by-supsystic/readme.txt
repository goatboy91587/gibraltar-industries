== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is my site 100% GDPR compliant if I'll install this plugin? =

* Installation of GDPR Cookie Consent by Supsystic can not provide 100% compliance with the GDPR as the site can be used third-party plugins and additions that do not comply with the GDPR standard
* At this point it is impossible to say what makes a site 100% compliant with GDPR or not because the regulation is not specific on (technical) solutions.


= Does GDPR Cookie Consent plugin block all cookies? =

The GDPR Cookie Consent plugin only limits cookies. Without updating all plugins it is technically impossible to completely block all cookies on the WordPress website. The best way out is to move the scripts that place cookies to the GDPR Cookie Consent plugin, and then allow visitors to make a choice. If the visitor decides to refuse, then the tracking codes do not load.
